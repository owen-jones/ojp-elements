# Owen Jones Custom Elements

`ojp-elements` is a collection of HTML custom elements that encapsulate the logic of our most frequently used UI patterns. Each element is built to be generic, reusable, and framework-agnostic.
The library is distributed as an NPM package, and is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/owen-jones/ojp-elements).

## Installing the Library

You can install the library in your project using the following command:

```bash
npm install @owen-jones/ojp-elements
```

## Using the Library

Import the library through a script tag in the **head** your HTML file.

```html
<script type='module' src='node_modules/@owen-jones/ojp-elements/dist/ojp-elements/ojp-elements.esm.js'></script>
<script nomodule src="node_modules/@owen-jones/ojp-elements/dist/ojp-elements/ojp-elements.js"></script>
<link rel='stylesheet' href='node_modules/@owen-jones/ojp-elements/dist/ojp-elements/ojp-elements.css'/>
```

You will then be able to use any element in your HTML as you would any regular HTML tag.

```html
<ojp-row cols='2'>
  <ojp-column>
    <h1>Hello world</h1>
  </ojp-column>
  <ojp-column>
    <p>Lorem ipsum....</p>
  </ojp-column>
</ojp-row>
```

## Global Breakpoints

Some elements use breakpoints to determine how they should be displayed. You should override the following
defaults in your own project's stylesheet according to your project's needs.

```css
--breakpoint--mobile: "(min-width: 320px)";
--breakpoint--tablet: "(min-width: 768px)";
--breakpoint--desktop: "(min-width: 1024px)";
```
