# Owen Jones Custom Elements

`ojp-elements` is a collection of HTML custom elements that encapsulate the logic of our most frequently used UI patterns. Each element is built to be generic, reusable, and framework-agnostic.
The library is distributed as an NPM package, and is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/owen-jones/ojp-elements).

## Using this library in a project:

### Using the library with NPM, Webpack or Gulp

Install the library in your project by running
```bash
npm install @ojp/ojp-elements@0.2.6
```

Import the loader in your main JavaScript file and invoke it:
```javascript
import { defineCustomElements } from '@ojp/ojp-elements/loader';
defineCustomElements();
```

Import the library styles in your main SCSS file:
```scss
@import "~@ojp/ojp-elements/dist/ojp-elements/ojp-elements.css";
```

### Using the library through the CDN

If you can't install the library into your project, the library can be imported
directly from the CDN through an HTML `<script>` tag.

Include the following imports in the `<head>` of your HTML file:

```html
<script type='module' src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@ojp/ojp-elements@0.2.3/dist/ojp-elements/ojp-elements.esm.min.js'></script>
<link rel='stylesheet' crossorigin='anonymous' href='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@ojp/ojp-elements@0.2.3/dist/ojp-elements/ojp-elements.min.css'/>
```

You will then be able to use any element in your HTML as you would any regular HTML tag.

```html
<ojp-row cols='2'>
  <ojp-column>
    <h1>Hello world</h1>
  </ojp-column>
  <ojp-column>
    <p>Lorem ipsum....</p>
  </ojp-column>
</ojp-row>
```

## Global Breakpoints

Some elements use breakpoints to determine how they should be displayed. You should override the following
defaults in your own project's stylesheet according to your project's needs.

```css
--breakpoint--mobile: "(min-width: 320px)";
--breakpoint--tablet: "(min-width: 768px)";
--breakpoint--desktop: "(min-width: 1024px)";
```
