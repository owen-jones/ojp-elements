# Owen Jones Custom Elements

`ojp-elements` is a collection of HTML custom elements that encapsulate the logic of our most frequently used UI patterns. Each element is built to be generic, reusable, and framework-agnostic.
The library is distributed as an NPM package, and is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/owen-jones/ojp-elements).

## Getting Started

Installing the library requires a valid GitHub token. To obtain a token, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).

Once you have a token, create a .npmrc file in your computer's home directory.

```bash
touch ~/.npmrc
```

Open the file and add the following line, replacing TOKEN with your token:

```bash
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=TOKEN
```

## Installing the Library

After you have created the .npmrc file, you can install the library in your project using the following command:

```bash
npm install @owen-jones/ojp-elements
```

## Using the Library

There are two ways to invoke the library:
1. If you are using a bundler such as Webpack or a framework like React, you can import elements directly into your JavaScript source as needed.

```js
import { OjpAccordion } from '@owen-jones/ojp-elements';
```

2. Alternatively, you can import the library through a script tag in the **head** your HTML file.

```html
<script type='module' src='node_modules/ojp-elements/dist/ojp-elements.esm.js'></script>
<script nomodule src="node_modules/ojp-elements/dist/ojp-elements.js"></script>
```

You will always need to import the global CSS file for the library.

```html
<link rel='stylesheet' href='node_modules/ojp-elements/dist/ojp-elements.css'/>
```

You will then be able to use any element in your HTML as you would any regular HTML tag.

```html
<ojp-row cols='2'>
  <ojp-column>
    <h1>Hello world</h1>
  </ojp-column>
  <ojp-column>
    <p>Lorem ipsum....</p>
  </ojp-column>
</ojp-row>
```
